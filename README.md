This is a site I challenged myself to make in one day with the goal of creating the simplest bookmarkable cryptocurrency website.
I started with the usual `npm init`, and then proceeded to create and publish it online.
This includes development and research of the site itself and APIs, domain registration, and deployment to Amazon Web Services.

Technology used:
- ReactJS
- Redux
- CoinMarketCap.com API
- AWS S3 + Cloudfront (This is what the live site uses right now; it hosts the React build.)

This project isn't perfect (especially looking back), because it was rushed to meet the 1-day deadline I set for myself.
Of course, some code could be cleaned up and redesigned, but the site functions as it was intended.
